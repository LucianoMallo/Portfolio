# Welcome to my very first React Web App

As is said below, this project was started with Create React App.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Here I want to show everything that I already know and it will be updated with new material that I will learn by myself.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
